HOW TO RUN:

The programme consists of two main.py files, one directly inside the folder and another one within the 'console' folder.
The main.py outside the console represents the student's side of our booking system, while the main.py inside the console folder
represents the professor's side of our booking system.

FOR PROFESSOR SIDE:
Run the 'main.py' file inside the console folder.

FOR STUDENT'S SIDE:
Run the 'main.py' file outside the console folder.
