HOW TO RUN:

The programme consists of two main.py files, one directly inside the folder and another one within the 'console' folder.
The main.py outside the console represents the student's side of our booking system, while the main.py inside the console folder
represents the professor's side of our booking system.

FOR PROFESSOR SIDE:
Run the 'main.py' file inside the console folder.

FOR STUDENT'S SIDE:
Run the 'main.py' file outside the console folder.
Then run 'ICBS_Station.py' (outside console) on the raspberry pi; and scan the nfc card to log in.

FOR TESTING PURPOSES:
To simulate the login without setting up the ICBS Station, run the following in the terminal:

$ Python3 DBManager.py login

Alternatively, run:

$ Python3 main.py login 

for the student side script (outside console folder)

To reset the database, run

$ Python3 DBManager.py

and follow the prompts. The first 'y' confirms the reset, and the second 'y' simulates a login**.

**note the student side client logs out the database on start up.
